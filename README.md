# nology Morse Code Project

This task will require you to create a web page Morse Code translator. The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

MVP
Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code

Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to add unit tests for your translating functions

Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

BONUS
Auto-detect the language
